# GPIO, SPI, I2C and USART drivers for STM32F407xx
GPIO, SPI, I2C and USART drivers were written to use in STM32F407xx Discovery Kit projects. A STM32F407xx project can be developed by using these drivers.

STM32Cube IDE was used to develop.

These drivers were developed by the developer for self-development.
